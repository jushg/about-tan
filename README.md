# Website

Source code for my [personal website](https://about-tan-jushg.vercel.app), hosted on
GitHub Pages.

This website is powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). To develop, run:

```sh-session
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Credit to [Eric Zhang](https://github.com/ekzhang), whom cool portfolio I took the template from, as I cannot do frontend.
