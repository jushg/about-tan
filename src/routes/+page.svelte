      I am currently a Computer Engineering undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore
    </p>

    <p>
      I am trying to learn more about algorithms and high-performance computing,and how they can address real-world problems. 
     </p> 

    <p>
     I usually tinker with new hardware and software through hackathons and personal projects, to try and make something cool. 
     Recently, I have also been fascinated by <em>Competitive Programming</em>, and have challenged myself with it.
