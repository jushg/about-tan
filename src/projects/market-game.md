Inspired by online prediction markets like
[PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/), the _Estimation Markets_ website allows
users to create real-time markets on Fermi estimation problems. Players use
their knowledge on the virtual trading floor, competing to earn the most money.
I used this app to run estimation markets in classes at
[SPARC](https://sparc-camp.org/),
[AlphaStar Academy](https://alphastar.academy/), and
[MIT Splash](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html), with great feedback
from the participants.
