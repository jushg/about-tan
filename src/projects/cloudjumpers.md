An IpadOS platformer game for 1-4 players, built as part of CS3217 Team Project and won 1st Prize at NUS 20th STEPS.

I designed and implemented an event-based synchronisation pipeline for this project, to de-conflict the actions of different players by using a central server as the single source of truth
