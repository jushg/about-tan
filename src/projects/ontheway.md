Built as part of CS3216 (Software Product Engineering for Digital Markets) to allow people to make impromptu friend inside of the NUS campus just by indicating that they are free and want to find people to hangout with.

I designed and implemented the backend of this Progressive Web App using Firebase Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, and also AWS and Twilio
 of automation of notifications task.
