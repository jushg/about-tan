A remote control car that can be control manually. It can also operate automatically on the pre-defined path with a simple object detection and avoidance feature.

I designed and implemented the bare-metal operating program of the remote control car, including a simplealgorithm for object detection and avoidance with using sound and infra-red sensors, using FreeRTOS as the base operating system.
