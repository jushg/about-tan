A remote control car that can be control manually or operate automatically on the pre-defined path with simple object detection and avoidance.

I designed and implemented the bare-metal operating program of the remote control car, including a simple algorithm for object detection and avoidance with using sound and infra-red sensors, using FreeRTOS as the base operating system.
